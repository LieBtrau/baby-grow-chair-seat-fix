The [ChildHome Baby Grow Chair Lambda 2](http://www.childhome.com/EN/288_568_642/0/4402/1/0/productdetail.html) is a chair that is adjustable in height.  Unfortunately the seat fixings are quite fragile.

This project has the mechanical description of replacement parts for the right as well as the left fixing.
Both pieces can be milled out of a 10mm thick plate.  Delrin is a suitable raw material.
