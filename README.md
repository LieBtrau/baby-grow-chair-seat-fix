# Description
![Baby grow chair](http://www.childhome.com/images/www.childhome.be/photolib/12148.jpg)
The [ChildHome Baby Grow Chair Lambda 2](http://www.childhome.com/EN/288_568_642/0/4402/1/0/productdetail.html) is a chair that is adjustable in height.  Unfortunately the seat fixings are quite fragile.

This project has the mechanical description of replacement parts for the right as well as the left fixing.
Both pieces can be milled out of a 10mm thick plate.  Delrin is a suitable raw material.

Inside this project you can find:

 - the source files, created with [HeeksCNC](https://github.com/Heeks/heekscnc).
 - the g-code data, that can be loaded into a [LinuxCNC controlled milling machine](http://linuxcnc.org/).
 - viewer data, to check the g-code data with [Camotics G-code viewer](http://www.camotics.org/).
